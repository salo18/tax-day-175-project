Tax Day

Tax Day is my first "on my own" project. The goal is to allow users to input important tax dates and then have the dates listed in an easy to see format. Later versions could allow users to print out the list or receive email notifications for reminders.

My business has different tax filings due to local, state and federal agencies as well as different income vs sales tax requirements. While I have all dates in a calendar, it could be nice to see them all laid out in one place. Since the requirements are the same every year, I keep track of day and month due but not the year.

I had fun making this app! I got to practice:
- designing my routes with Sinatra
- using the session to keep track of a user's login status 
- connecting an app to a database and using SQL to store and retrieve user input
- designing forms and tables with HTML and CSS
